          In the case of Norway you can go on endlessly, so here I will just use a short list
        </p>
        <p> - The stores have a much smaller assortment than in Poland or other EU countries. Norway mainly focuses on its own products and imports little.</p>
        <p>- Cold cuts in Norway are full of chemicals and there are no real butcher shops. </p>
        <p>-Many Norwegian products contain sugar, such as bread or pickled herring. Many products are also sweeter than in Poland - cakes, rolls, etc.</p>
        <p>- Regular salt is less salty than ours - if you like salt it better then buy pink or flake salt.</p>
        <p>- Norwegians love polish "Ptasie Mleczko" </p>
        <p>- A typical Norwegian delicacy is the so-called brunost (brown cheese) - this is goat cheese with a hint of caramel and it is nowhere else in the world. The taste is very interesting! </p>

          May 17 - National Day of Norway</p>
        <p>
          May 17 is the most important day of the year in Norway. Anyone who has ever been to Norway that day will be charmed.
          Parades with the orchestra are almost all day long. In Oslo, the King of Norway salutes the nation from his balcony. Flags are everywhere, and the Norwegians are dressed in a festive way, in traditional folk costumes - Bunad.
          Bunad varies from region to region and costs a fortune - it is often passed down from generation to generation, especially in the female line. In Poland, we see folk costumes only in folk song and dance groups, tradition does not exist on a daily basis, we do not know what our costumes look like. For Norwegians, this is a ceremonial outfit.
          Did you know that in Norway, during the national holiday, people make wishes for each other? Glatulerer med dagen, our "Happy Birthday". Norwegians are happy and proud of what a country they are and that their country is independent.
          It does not arouse conflicts as it happens during the Independence Marches - it is a holiday for all who love Norway, regardless of their origin, orientation or political views. </p>

          Differences in education</p>
        <p>
          In Norway, grades are awarded only from the 8th grade. Low grades do not mean that the student will not be promoted to the next grade or will have to repeat the whole year due to failing one subject. In a situation where the child has not been able to cope with mathematics in a given semester, he or she has a chance to catch up by attending classes in the lower grade. Similarly, a particularly gifted student may pursue a given subject in a higher grade.</p>
